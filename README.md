# multi-pass
multi-pass is a tool to transparently work with multiple pass repositories.

## Motivation
The experience of using multiple repositories with pass is not great.

## Installation
Soon(tm) from pypi, for now please build from source.

## CLI usage
You can run the tool on the CLI after installation with `multi-pass`.

## Development
multi-pass uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
To build a pip-installable wheel, run `poetry build`.
